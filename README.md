# Super Nostalgia Zone Plus
Written by Beyond 5D

Script goal:
This script is not a malicious script and is actually the complete opposite, it aims to make CloneTrooper's "Super Nostalgia Zone" game as accurate as possible to the 2008 version of Roblox, I got most of the info from 2008 from old clients, Roblox Wikipedias and old YouTube videos. This script gives you no benefit in-game (Other then making the game look more 2008-like lol) and if CloneTrooper wants this script taken down I won't hesitate to do so.

Known bugs:

Plan list:
- Customisable settings

Supported exploits:
- Synapse X
- Script-Ware
- KRNL

FAQ:
1:
Q: When executing I get a message saying "We have detected that you are not using a executor tested to run this script, you may experience issues."
A: This error means that you are using a exploit that wasn't tested by the developers to load this script, the executors mentioned under "Supported exploits" are designed to run theses scripts, we have plans on giving other exploits support though
2:
Q: When executing I get a message saying "We recommend you to play in 1176 x 664 or lower resolution."
A: This is because your monitors resolution is high, we recommend you play in 1176 x 664 or lower resolution, although if you don't wish to do so it isn't that big of a problem as the script will run perfectly fine at any resolution. If you don't know how to change your resolution here is a guide on it: https://youtu.be/3GdKiUAnyHc?t=37
3:
Q: The game is running at 30 fps
A: 2008 Roblox was locked to 30 fps
4:
Q: Are there any settings that I can configure for this script?
A: No, despite the "GameSettings" table a couple lines under this text, that is used to store all the in-game settings automatically and isn't meant to be changed by players, please avoid changing any lines if you do not know what your doing. (There are plans to adding settings soon!)
5:
Q: Why don't you just make your own 2008 Roblox game if you can very easily convert this game into a near 2008 replica
A: I do have a project in the works which will be simulating 2008 but I haven't spent to much time on it and personally exploits gives developers a lot more freedom to do what they want, Roblox is locked to certain stuff, for example: hiding the pause menu icon, setting a maximum limit for graphics level quality, etc but with exploits I can do pretty much everything I would want to be in my 2008 simulator, and the reason I can't just make a 2008 simulator and have a script for exploiters to run when they join my game is because it will most likely get banned and you'll be playing with other exploiters which most likely means there will be a lot of malicious exploiting, by using this game instead you are playing with regular players doing regular things and also meet some new players to the game which just enhance the experience and making it more immersive.
6:
Q: How to use this script?
A: Simply open your exploit directory and go to "autoexec" and put a lua file inside of this folder named "Super Nostalgia Zone Plus.lua" and inside of this lua file put this text inside of it "loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/5GYCUjGG"))()" do not worry about taking this script out when you do not plan on playing this game as this script only executes when you are in the correct game.
7:
Q: Can I use malicious scripts with this script injected
A: Yes, this script will not stop you from exploiting the game.
8:
Q: Can I get terminated/game-banned from using this script?
A: In regards to account termination, your account has a extraordinary low chance of being terminated, and if you were terminated for exploiting it wasn't related to this script, Roblox usually does ban waves which is quite rare on it's own but you'll most likely be notified in the Synapse X/Script-Ware/KRNL discord server or on V3rmillion about theses ban waves. As for game-bans it is unknown, although yes this script is harmless that doesn't mean CloneTrooper has approved of this script and he can ban users for using this script since it is messing with his game code.
9:
Q: I have a suggestion to make
A: There is currently no way to make a suggestion but there are plans on making a Discord server or at least a suggestion tab in the game itself.
