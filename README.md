# Super Nostalgia Zone Plus

Credits:
CloneTrooper1019 - Creating Super Nostalgia Zone (He didn't do any work on this script but made the game this script runs on)
Beyond 5D - Writing all of the code

Script goal:
This script is not a malicious script and is actually the complete opposite, it aims to make CloneTrooper's "Super Nostalgia Zone" game as accurate as possible to the 2008 version of Roblox, I got most of the info from 2008 from old clients, Roblox Wikipedias and old YouTube videos. This script gives you no benefit in-game (Other then making the game look more 2008-like lol) and if CloneTrooper wants this script taken down I won't hesitate to do so.

Known bugs:
- None

Plan list:
- Customisable settings

Supported exploits:
- Synapse X
